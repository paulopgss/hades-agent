      <p><strong>Hades Agent is an intelligent virtual desktop assistant (Windows), built with Electron and React. It functions as a "floating widget" that offers advanced text chat and a powerful voice transcription mode with real-time insights via Gemini Live.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Security Boundaries:</strong> Sandboxed with <strong>zero write access to the system</strong> (cannot natively create, edit, or delete local files via chat). The intelligence is entirely focused on interface support and productivity.</p>

## Key Features

- **MiniChat:** A minimalist floating chat, conversing directly with the AI, designed for quick access and global shortcuts.
- **Susurro Mode (Real-Time Insights):** Much more than a simple voice recorder. By activating the "Suggestions/Insights" mode, Hades stops acting just as a transcriber and actively listens to your context. It works as a *brainstorming partner*, identifying questions, problems, or discussion topics in real time and providing ideas, quick answers, and solutions directly on the screen. The model has been strictly instructed (via `insight_rules.md`) to be concise, agile, and to hide internal monologues (CoT), delivering only the final value directly for you to read while speaking.
- **Persistent History:** The application automatically saves your text and audio sessions in the backend, generating smart titles based on the context of the conversation.
- **Overlay & Glassmorphism UI:** Premium design with fluid transparency, side menus, and high responsiveness.
- **Native Resizing:** System-level optimized window resizing loop (`requestAnimationFrame` + IPC fast-fire) for immaculate performance on Windows.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript / JavaScript (Node.js + Browser)
- **Desktop Framework:** Electron (v42+)
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite 8
- **Styling:** Pure Vanilla CSS with CSS Variables & Backdrop Filters
- **AI and APIs:** `@google/genai`, `@google/generative-ai`, `@google-cloud/speech`
- **Audio:** `recordrtc`
- **Packager:** `electron-builder`

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher.
- NPM or pnpm.
- A valid **Google Gemini API** key.
- OS: Windows (packaging is focused on `.exe` and portable apps on Windows).

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victorl-dev/Hades-Agent.git
cd hades-agent
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure the API Key

It is not necessary to create a `.env` file manually. When starting the application for the first time, you can configure your API key directly in the system interface:
1. Open the **Settings** by clicking the gear icon or pressing the global shortcut `Alt + S`.
2. Enter your **Google Gemini API** key.
3. The key will be securely encrypted and saved locally by Electron.

### 4. Run in Development Environment

The command below will start Vite (to compile React) and Electron (your native window) in parallel.

```bash
npm run dev
```

*Note: In case of residual crashes, the command automatically kills stuck 3000 ports and terminates zombie Electron processes.*

---

## Architecture

Hades Agent uses a unified Single Window architecture. The main application state toggles the internal interfaces, keeping the Electron window alive and resizing accordingly.

```

### Data Flow & IPC

Hades communicates its graphical interface (React) with APIs and file manipulation (Node.js) through the `contextBridge` defined in `preload.js`. 

```
User Action (React) 
  → window.electronAPI (Preload) 
    → ipcMain.on / handle (Node.js / Electron) 
      → aiService.js or sessions.json
        → window.webContents.send (Response to React)
```

### Key Components

**Sessions System (`sessions.json`)**
- Transcriptions and conversations are saved in session format. The application asks the AI to generate a short title and permanently saves it to the HDD.

**Real-Time Resizing (`windowManager.js`)**
- We use the `resize-window-fast` IPC pattern instead of promise-based IPC channels. The client fires fast mouse events via `requestAnimationFrame`, allowing the Electron window to be dragged and expanded at 60fps without Main-Thread delay.

**Integrated Gemini Live**
- In Susurro mode, we activate `isSuggestionsMode` in the Gemini WebSocket streaming. This instructs the AI model to return instant insights filtering its own "Internal Monologues" to avoid polluting the user's final view.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts development server (React + Electron) with Auto-Reload. |
| `npm run build` | Builds production only for the React layer. |
| `npm run package` | Builds the Electron executable for Windows (`.exe`). |
| `npm run dist` | Builds React and then packages it into installable (`nsis`) and portable formats. |
| `npm run test` | Runs tests with Vitest. |

---

## Deployment & Packaging

To distribute the application, use `electron-builder` which is properly configured in `package.json`.

### Generating Installers (Windows)

```bash
npm run dist
```

This will create a `release/` folder in the root of your project containing:
- `Hades-Agent-Setup-2.0.0.exe` (Traditional installer)
- `Hades-Agent-2.0.0-portable.exe` (Standalone app)
- `.zip` files and optional unpacked files.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Stuck Port Errors (Port 3000)
**Problem:** Vite reports that port 3000 is already in use.
**Solution:** The `npm run dev` script tries to kill the port via `kill-port`. If it persists, run in the Windows terminal: 
`npx kill-port 3000`

### Window Freezes on Resize
**Solution:** Make sure there is no CSS component doing `transition: all` on `.app-container`. CSS layout transitions tied with Electron's ResizeObserver freeze the OS Main Thread.

### Gemini API Returning Error
**Solution:** Verify if your `.env` was loaded correctly. Since the file is at the root of Electron, `dotenv` initialized in `main.js` will read it. 

---

## Settings and API Keys

The system manages keys dynamically and securely, without the need for exposed `.env` files in the root.

### How to Configure

| Setting | Description | Where to Find / Insert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API Key for AI and chat | Settings Menu (`Alt + S`) |

### Access via Electron

The key entered in the Settings UI is passed to the backend services (`aiService.js`, `geminiLiveService.js`) using the Electron process (via `ipcRenderer.invoke`). The Backend saves these settings and manages them in isolation, preventing access keys from being insecurely transmitted or leaked when building the web application with Vite.

---

## Testing

The environment is configured to use **Vitest** due to native integration with Vite.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in watch mode
npm run test

# To run once in continuous integration (CI)
npx vitest run
```

*Note: Tests can still be expanded to cover IPC (Inter-Process Communication) integrations using mocks for native Electron modules.*
